# VR Sketch Website

### Folders
Working files go in ".resources"
Public files go in ".web"
Pre-compiled files go in ".src"

### update_website.py
This script is called when we commit to the master branch.
It compiles selected files from ".src" to ".web"

### .src/template.html
This is the example template layout to copy/past from. (one day we will use a real templating engine)
