        VR Sketch is a tool for creating, editing and viewing your SketchUp models in virtual reality.<br>
        With one click send any SketchUp file to VR.<br>
        All the main SketchUp tools are available in VR so now you can stand inside your model and edit it with your hands.<br>
        Join a friend and work on the same project together in real time.
    </p>
    <p>
        VR Sketch has a two-way live-link with SketchUp so the changes you make in VR are updated in SketchUp and vice versa.<br>
        This means there is no exporting, importing, downloading or uploading to the cloud; just work like you would in SketchUp.
