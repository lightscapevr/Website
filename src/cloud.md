One of the many aspects of VR-based editing we wanted to explore was
collaborative editing of files over the internet. While we don't have yet
a version to edit files collaboratively we would like to present you with a beta
that lets you view files and chat to each other.

The idea is as follows - multiple people can enter the same model at any time
and exchange ideas, notes etc. This can be useful for showing a client or for
doing design reviews across many offices or even at one office with multiple
headsets.

There are three steps involved in the process:

1. Go to [VR Sketch cloud](https://test.vrsketch.eu/cloud.html), log in
   and upload your file.

2. Download [VR Sketch viewer](https://xxx-some-URL), unzip and run the `exe`

3. Go to [VR Sketch cloud](https://test.vrsketch.eu/cloud.html) and either
   click `view` or `share` to give others access to your file. You should be able
   to see and hear each other in the model.

Enjoy!
