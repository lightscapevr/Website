                    <p>This post is an interview with Adam Wysocki from
                        <a href="http://studiodemateria.com/en">Studio de Materia</a>, who is an early user and has contributed a lot of early feedback for VR Sketch.
                        The interview has been translated from Polish and edited for clarity.
                    </p>

                    <p class="question">Hi Adam. Glad you could make it. I would like to ask you a few questions about your work as an architect
                        and your experience with VR Sketch. Please introduce yourself to our readers first and tell us a
                        bit about your work.</p>
                    <p class="answer">Hi, thanks for the interview. My name is Adam Wysocki and I’m an architect from Poznan, Poland. Since
                        2013, I have been running my own studio. Since then we have developed small, diverse projects, mainly
                        residential. Our goal is to add valuable buildings to our environment through a customized architecture
                        whose function and form are in harmony. For example, we are now building a complex of two mountain
                        lodges in Karkonosze national park.</p>

                    <img class="shadow img scale" src="img/blog/studiodemateria-1.jpg" alt="studio de materia" width="770px">

                    <p class="question">Please tell me something about your daily work - how involved are you in the various stages of the architectural
                        projects.
                    </p>
                    <p class="answer">My studio is very small, so I’m personally involved in all the steps, starting from the first contact
                        with the client. During the conceptual stages of the project, I have direct contact with all the
                        decisions made. Only during the later stages of the project, other people are getting more involved,
                        either my co-workers or external contractors.</p>
                    <p class="answer">The first conceptual part is very important for me as this part defines the foundations of all the future
                        decisions. The crucial piece of the conceptual part of the project is interaction with client, while
                        taking into account the laws and restrictions on buildings. I try to put emphasis on “client first”
                        strategy here - at the end of the day their wishes have to be articulated in the building. Creating
                        perfectly functioning spatial choreography dressed with architectural guise that expresses my formal
                        preferences is my goal for the design.</p>
                    <p class="answer">This part of the project often drags on, until both the client and I are satisfied with selected solutions.
                    </p>

                    <img class="shadow img scale" src="img/blog/studiodemateria-2.jpg" alt="studio de materia" width="770px">

                    <p class="question">How does virtual reality in general and VR Sketch in particular play a role here?</p>
                    <p class="answer">I had the opportunity to use virtual reality for the last couple months. This has revolutionized the
                        conceptual part of the project. I can, directly and at all times, control the spatial relationships
                        that happen in the project. Besides the fact that virtual reality is a great tool for designing objects
                        at different scales, from the smallest detail to urban planning, it has immense impact on the verification
                        of decisions taken as if they were real. For me, once I start BEING in the virtual reality, it BECOMES
                        reality. When I enter my own project, I am able to shape it like a sculptor or demiurg.</p>
                    <p class="answer">I still begin with flat drawings in autocad and later I export them to Sketchup and VR Sketch. Modelling
                        in virtual reality my early ideas become tested. Using virtual reality lets me experiment much more
                        easily with new solutions that would otherwise be considered too risky.</p>
                    <p class="answer">In this day and age, Computer Aided Design is very advanced and we can do a lot just using design programs
                        that don’t require VR. However, VR Sketch is a very easy way to work on a model while having real
                        control. It’s akin to creating a life-size mockup with the difference being the ability to make dynamic
                        and spontaneous changes while looking from a perspective from ant-size to king-kong.</p>
                    <p class="answer">I can’t say that what I do would be impossible without VR, but it would be definitely a lot less fun.
                    </p>

                    <img class="shadow img scale" src="img/blog/studiodemateria-3.jpg" alt="studio de materia" width="770px">

                    <p class="question">How do you think Virtual Reality will change architecture?</p>
                    <p class="answer">I think that my clients, who often find it hard to read complicated drawings and “frozen” visualizations,
                        can now use tools to quickly verify the quality of chosen solutions. At the same time, architects
                        could choose even more audacious solutions to both formal and functional problems. It will certainly
                        help avoid a lot of mistakes and architecture will gain.</p>

                    <img class="shadow img" src="img/blog/studiodemateria-4.jpg" alt="studio de materia" width="300px">

                    <p class="question">What would you tell people who have not tried VR Sketch just yet?</p>
                    <p class="answer">Entering the project in VR, or even a demo often brings the fear of unknown. Don’t be afraid! I don’t
                        understand why people are so skeptical - it’s enough to put a virtual reality helmet on once and
                        you will feel the difference immediately. These days I definitely prefer working in Virtual Reality,
                        where the sun always shines than in front of a sad monitor :-) The revolution in design is coming
                        in seven mile steps.</p>

                    <img class="shadow img scale" src="img/blog/studiodemateria-5.jpg" alt="studio de materia" width="770px">

                    <p class="question">What would you say about the VR Sketch user interface?</p>
                    <p class="answer">It’s very good, but it requires some time and effort to be proficient. The real pleasure only comes after
                        learning how to use it for a bit, when you realize it’s actually very simple and intuitive. I don’t
                        think you even need to know sketchup well - it’s simple enough to learn directly in VR.</p>

                    <p class="question">Thanks a lot! I hope it will be useful for our readers!</p>

                    <p>Hello everyone.</p>
                    <p>VR Sketch is an editing/visualization tool for architects. Currently integrates with
                        <a class="reference external" href="https://www.sketchup.com">sketchup</a>, with more software coming in the future. If you want to learn more, see the
                        <a class="reference external" href="https://vrsketch.eu">main page</a>. This blog post is about the current state of affairs in virtual reality for architecture
                        from the perspective of VR sketch.</p>
                </section>
                <section id="introduction">
                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>I don't think it's a secret that Virtual Reality is the future interface for architecture. Everyone is
                        talking about it, looking at and investigating it. In this blog post I would like to do a review
                        of the current potential of VR ecosystem, mostly focusing on the hardware and low level software.
                        I'm deliberately
                        <strong>not</strong> going to talk about the architecture software for VR, since I'm more interested in what's
                        possible as opposed to what has been done.
                    </p>
                    <p>First, let me reiterate the obvious - being able to
                        <strong>see</strong> the building you're designing (or a car or a piece of wood, metal part or anything like
                        that) is an incredible improvement over the status quo. It's akin to what-you-see-is-what-you-get
                        in text editors. There is a good reason why Word is much more popular than TeX, punch cards got obsolete
                        and we draw lines with a mouse as opposed to typing
                        <code>line(0,0,100,100)</code>. There are two more slightly less obvious benefits of using VR - you have a very good camera control,
                        as humans are used to just moving their head to have new perspective and you have a clunky, but usable,
                        3D point input with the controllers.</p>
                </section>
                <section id="vr-visualizations-and-editing">
                    <h3>VR visualizations and editing</h3>
                    <img class="img" width="80%" src="img/blog/VRSketch1.png">
                    <p>Right now the king in VR for architecture is visualizations, especially for the end client. There is
                        a good reason for that - the minimum work required to get the visualization going is relatively limited
                        and does not require deep interaction with controllers as UI. Doing visualizations that look good
                        is
                        <strong>tons of work</strong> of course, but that part is (mostly) left out to users themselves and not to
                        the software. Obviously software has to allow it and some make it easier than others. The obvious
                        next step is seeing the buildings as you design them and sooner or later one starts feeling that
                        taking the helmet on and off is annoying. That's where editing and VR sketch, comes to play.</p>
                    <p>Which brings us to the long list of limitations that are present. I hope we will get around to addressing
                        all of them, either in VR Sketch or in the hardware.
                    </p>

                <section id="headsets">
                    <h3>Headsets</h3>
                    <p>VR Sketch for now works only in HTC Vive, but there is nothing stopping us from working with other high-end
                        headsets, other than having those headsets. The headsets are
                        <strong>good</strong>. Unlike the low-end tier, the illusion is very real and the feel of space is good enough.
                        I would not mind better resolution for photo realism, more text etc. but it's all coming. Disclaimer:
                        I haven't had a chance to play with the new headsets - Vive Pro or Samsung Odyssey.</p>
                </section>
                <section id="controllers-and-input">
                    <h3>Controllers and input</h3>
                    <img class="img" src="./img/blog/headsets-600x150.png">
                    <p>The controllers and the general input is the main limiting factor of doing editing right in the VR. One
                        loses access to keyboard &amp; mouse, while gaining access to relatively clunky controllers with
                        limited buttons. The controllers themselves are based a lot on gaming controllers plus six degress
                        of freedom. This works great for the primary purpose which is gaming! But for something more professional,
                        like work of architects, the lack of precision, lack of buttons and lack of basic software research
                        done in the terms of VR user experience is a serious problem. We believe we did a good job given
                        the constraints, but there are very serious limitations that will make it uneconomic to do certain
                        edits in VR. We believe that those factors will diminish over time -- we will improve the software,
                        the controllers will get better and eventually disappear in favor of hand gestures and people will
                        find it easier to do more and more stuff in VR. There is also issue of text/measurment input which
                        will probably be solved in a bunch of ways, including voice support that we're working on.</p>
                </section>
                <section id="ergonomics-of-office-space">
                    <h3>Ergonomics of office space</h3>
                    <p>Right now, since the building blocks are relatively large (think duplo instead of lego), we need large
                        space in order to work on a building. That brings fatigue, due to large hand movements and requires
                        a lot of free office space. In the future, we will see stuff getting smaller and smaller to the point
                        where building buildings will remind a lot more about building stuff from legos, but without stepping
                        on them, then it is right now.</p>

                    <h3>Road to the future</h3>
                    <p>The future is exciting :-) At VR Sketch we believe most architects will move to editing in VR for day
                        to day operations within 5-15 years. We are a bit ahead of the curve here, but we will stick around
                        to see it raise. You should
