                    <p>VR Sketch is a tool for visualizing and editing architectural models from SketchUp in virtual reality. The current setup requires SketchUp and HTC Vive or Oculus Touch (it has been known to work with Windows Mixed Reality headsets, but it's not officially supported).</p>

                    <p><strong>Visualizing:</strong> we give an accurate, fast, cartoonish-but-good-looking rendering of large models. It has been tested with SketchUp files that are hundreds of MBs in size.</p>

                    <p><strong>Editing:</strong> we give an editing process that mimics SketchUp's own. You have most of the simple SketchUp tools available in VR, with similar alignment and measure tools. Changes to the model in VR are instantly visible on the 2D monitor in SketchUp, and vice-versa.</p>

                    <p>VR Sketch can be used for 14 days without registration.
                    After registration, you have 14 more days before the first
                    monthly payment is made.  There is a single version of VR
                    Sketch.  It is always recommended to grab the latest version.</p>

                        Note that <strong>alignment guides</strong> are used for most tools below.  Move
                        any of the two controllers over an existing geometrical object to choose it for
                        alignment: vertex, edge or face.
                        Then move the controller back where you want.  If this position is close to
                        being on the same axis or the same plane, then the position "snaps" to that
                        axis or plane and an alignment guide is drawn.
                        You can select several geometrical objects to align to.  You can
                        also select the origin of the drawing axes.

                    <h1 id="Settings">Settings</h1>
                    <p>In two-persons settings, you can look at the SketchUp model on the computer while the other person is
                        in the VR headset. His location is visible in the SketchUp model as the "Beret Guy"---as long as
                        the "VR teleport" tool is selected (it is initially selected). An infinite blinking line extends
                        vertically, to help locate him in very large models. You can also teleport Beret Guy (and the person
                        in the VR) to a new location simply by clicking on the model. Note that this makes the whole setup
                        usable even in minimal situations where the person in the headset is not given any controller. </p>
                    <p>The "Copy VR location" button (or "Center view" menu item) does the opposite synchronization: when clicked,
                        it changes the SketchUp camera to match the current VR headset location.
                        When you move the mouse over the model, the person in the headset sees a mouse
                        cursor moving over the VR model.  Conversely, when the person uses the teleport
                        beam, its target location shows up in SketchUp too (even if it is on a wall, for
                        example, where he cannot teleport to).  This gives a way for each person to show
                        particular elements of the model to the other.</p>
