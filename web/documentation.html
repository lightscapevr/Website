                    <p>In two-persons settings, you can look at the SketchUp model on the computer while the other person is
                        in the VR headset. His location is visible in the SketchUp model as the "Beret Guy"---as long as
                        the "VR teleport" tool is selected (it is initially selected). An infinite blinking line extends
                        vertically, to help locate him in very large models. You can also teleport Beret Guy (and the person
                        in the VR) to a new location simply by clicking on the model. Note that this makes the whole setup
                        usable even in minimal situations where the person in the headset is not given any controller. </p>
                    <p>The "Copy VR location" button (or "Center view" menu item) do the opposite synchronization: when clicked,
                        it changes the SketchUp camera to match the current VR headset location. Changes to the SketchUp
                        model should be immediately visible in the VR headset. If they are not (likely because of a bug),
                        you need to reselect "Send to VR", which sends the whole model from scratch.</p>

                    <h2 id="Tools">Reporting bugs</h2>
                    <p>Please report any other rendering bug to the issue tracker or by writing to the e-mail below.</p>
                    <h2 id="Tools">Known issues</h2>
                    <p> In large models, it takes a few seconds before the in-VR teleport starts working.
                    </p>
                    <p>Only planar faces, with or without texture, are rendered. This excludes floating edges and more advanced
                        SketchUp constructs like "Images", construction lines, text labels, and so on. Also, the "smooth"
                        edge option is not supported yet: it is rendered as a regular hard edge.
                    </p>
                    <p>We could improve the way the teleport picks its destination in case the beam touches a wall or ceiling.
                        Also, there is a light source that follows the player after a teleport, but it is always positioned
                        at the center of the play area, which might be behind a wall.
                    </p>
                    <p>Textures may very occasionally appear badly positioned when you open a subgroup. This is because textures
                        can be either positioned or non-positioned (right-click, Texture, "Reset Position" makes it non-positioned).
                        However, non-positioned textures are reported at a bogus position by SketchUp's Ruby API when editing
                        inside groups or components. We work around that by computing what the Ruby API gives us in this
                        case. If we get that, then we assume that it was a non- positioned texture that is misreported, and
                        fix it manually. This might occasionally be fooled if it was actually a *positioned* texture that
                        is exactly at the same position.
