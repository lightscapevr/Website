            <p>How to choose the tool you want to use with each controller.</p>
            <video autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop">
                <source src="./img/docs/tool-choose.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
            </video>

            <ul>
                <li>To choose a tool, hold in the
                    <strong>menu button</strong>, a list of tools will appear in front of the controller, move the controller to
                    the tool you would like to use. The tools icon will highlight when the controller is over it. Release
                    the
                    <strong>menu button</strong> while you are over the tool to select it. You will see the icon on the controller
                    will change to the current tool of that controller.</li>
                <li>Each controller can have only one active tool.</li>
                <li>Each controller has the same list of tools available.</li>
                <li>You can have two different tools on each controller or the same tool on both controllers.</li>
                <li>With some tools, when you start use that tool the other controller can be used to help with that action.</li>
                <li>You cannot use two tools simultaneously (but you can use them in succession).</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Navigation tools</h2>
            <h3>Teleport tool</h3>
            <p>The tool for moving around your model at 1:1 scale.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pull in the
                    <strong>trigger</strong> to aim where you would like to teleport to.</li>
                <li>Release the
                    <strong>trigger</strong> to teleport to your selected position.</li>
                <li>If the pointer is blue you can teleport, if the pointer is pink you cannot teleport.</li>
                <li>When you teleport the scale is always changed to 1:1.</li>
                <li>While holding the
                    <strong>trigger</strong> in, you can scroll the
                    <strong>touchpad</strong> to set how the pointer works:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Short arch</li>
                        <li>Middle arch (default)</li>
                        <li>Long arch</li>
                        <li>Straight line</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>When you are not inside the warehouse, there is a small warehouse icon; aim on it to teleport back to the
                    original warehouse view.</li>
                <li>As a shortcut, teleport straight up (slightly to the back) will also return to the original warehouse view.</li>
                <li>The teleport preview arch will bounce off vertical or slanted surfaces.</li>
                <li>The teleport preview arch can pass through transparent surfaces. If the surface is half-transparent, the
                    arch will pass through if it aims straight through it, but not if it reaches the surface from a shallow
                    angle.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Zoom and Pan</h3>
            <p>Navigate around your model at any scale. This is not a standard tool; instead, it is always available, using
                the
                <strong>grip</strong> button.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Zoom with both controllers. Press in the
                    <strong>grip</strong> button on both controllers at the same time, then move the controllers towards each other
                    to zoom in or away from each other to zoom out.</li>
                <li>Zoom with one controller. Hold in the
                    <strong>grip</strong> button on a controller and then scroll on the
                    <strong>touchpad</strong> to zoom in or out.</li>
                <li>Pan. Press in the
                    <strong>grip</strong> button on one controller and move the controller. The model will move with the controller
                    until you release the
                    <strong>grip</strong> button.</li>
                <li>When zooming, red text will appear between the two controllers indicating what scale you are at. The scale
                    will snap to certain common scales.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Selection tools</h2>

                    <strong>trigger</strong> to select it. It that geometry is already selected it will deselect it.
                    <ul>
                        <li>You can move the controller while the
                            <strong>trigger</strong> is pressed to select or deselect more.</li>
                        <li>If you pull the
                            <strong>trigger</strong> twice quickly, like double clicking, you will select the geometry adjacent the
                            object your controller is touching.</li>
                        <li>If you pull the
                            <strong>trigger</strong> three times quickly, you will select all the geometry touching the object your
                            controller is touching.</li>

                </li>
                <li>Box select. While your controller is not touching any geometry pull in the
                    <strong>trigger</strong> and drag the controller. This will create a selection box and will select anything that
                    is inside the box.
                    <ul>
                        <li>If you drag from the top down your selection (in blue) will include only the geometry fully inside
                            the box.</li>
                        <li>If you drag from the bottom up your selection (in green) will include all the geometry that touches
                            the box.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The select tool gives you a preview of what will be selected by highlighting the geometry in blue.</li>
                <li>De-select everything. With the select tool active, click on nothing to de-select any current selections.</li>
                <li>De-select individual things. With the select tool active, click on any currently selected geometry to de-select
                    it. There is pink preview highlighting what will be de-selected.</li>

                    to the section plain. Click a second time to set the orientation of the plain.</li>
                <li>To remove a section plain, hold in the
                    <strong>menu button</strong> and choose the
                    <strong>Delete section plain</strong> tool. This tool is only visible if you have already created a section plain.</li>
                <li>You can only create one section plain at a time.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Hide and Un-hide tool</h3>
            <p>The tool to control what you can an cannot see.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To hide any geometry, first use the
                    <strong>select</strong> tool to select what you want to hide, then hold down the
                    <strong>menu button</strong> and move the controller over the
                    <strong>Hide</strong> tool and release the
                    <strong>menu button</strong>.</li>
                <li>To un-hide all your hidden geometry hold down the
                    <strong>menu button</strong> and move the controller over the
                    <strong>Un-Hide all</strong> tool and release the
                    <strong>menu button</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Tool Extras</h2>
            <h3>Canceling any action</h3>
            <p>How to end or stop doing an action.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To end an action you don't want to do, press the
                    <strong>menu button</strong> to cancel the current action.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Setting lengths</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>When dragging out a length like when using the
                    <strong>Line</strong> or
                    <strong>Push/Pull</strong> tools the length snaps to logical increments depending on the current scale. If you
                    are zoomed out the length might snap to the nearest meter. If you are zoomed in the length might snap
                    to the nearest mm.</li>
                <li>Whenever the length measurement is visible it is possible to manually inputting a length by clicking on the
                    numbers with the other controller. For example if you start drawing a line with your right controller,
                    you can use the left controller to click on the measurement text. A small calculator window will appear
                    where you can use the
                    <strong>trigger</strong> to input any length you wish the line to be.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Snapping</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Axis snapping. Many actions like drawing a line or rectangle automatically snap to the x,y,z axis. The guidelines
                    change colour (red, green and blue) to match the axis currently snapped to. </li>
                <li>Plane snapping. Many actions also snap to the x,y,z planes. This is indicated by a small coloured square
                    the the controllers tip. The square changes colour to match the plane it is snapping to.</li>
                <li>Point snapping. Many actions snap to the nearest point, line, midpoint of a line or face.</li>
                <li>The distance at which snapping starts to happen can be set in the
                    <strong>configurations menu</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Locking</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Locking an axis or plane. Many actions like drawing a line or rectangle can have their axis locked. This
                    is done by using the controller not doing the action to click on the length indicator line or plane indicator
                    guideline.
                </li>
                <li>When locking is available an icon of a lock will appear on the length indicator line.</li>
                <li>To unlock a locked axis or plane, pull the
                    <strong>trigger</strong> of the controller not doing the main action.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Guidelines</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>When drawing, guidelines and reference points(white spheres) will appear and mark what points the current
                    action is snapping to. </li>
                <li>When drawing with one controller you can move the other controller over a point to create a reference point
                    and guideline that the first controller can snap to.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Bugs and errors</h1>
            <h3>What should work and what does not</h3>
            <p>Changes to the SketchUp model should be immediately visible in the VR headset. If they are not (likely because
                of a bug), you need to reselect "Send to VR", which sends the whole model from scratch.</p>
            <p>Most VR bugs should show up as a long piece of text on top of the VR mirror screen. When reporting such a bug,
                please give us a complete copy of this text (you can use copy-paste).</p>
            <p>There is however one known situation in which a bug might cause a silent failure. After you complete an editing
                operation in VR (and provided you are not running the unlicensed version, in which case you just see "License
                needed" on the controllers): if you don't see the changes, try opening the Ruby console in SketchUp ("Window"
                menu) and repeat the procedure. If it is a bug in the Ruby side, it should be reported there.</p>
            <p>In large models, it takes a few seconds before the in-VR teleport starts working (even after loading appears
                complete).
            </p>
            <p>Most editing operations will cause pauses if your model is medium-large and doesn't use groups or components.
                This is because groups and components are currently the unit of transfer between the SketchUp and the Unity
                side.
            </p>
            <p>We render the following elements in VR: faces (with or without texture); edges; and "Images". This excludes more
                advanced SketchUp constructs like construction lines, text labels, and so on. The "soft" edge option is supported,
                but not the "smooth" one: all edges appear sharp.</p>
            <p>We could improve the way the teleport picks its destination in case the beam touches a wall or ceiling.</p>
            <p>Textures may very occasionally appear badly positioned when you open a subgroup. (This issue cannot occur if
                you don't have any group or component opened for editing.) The cause is SketchUp's textures, which can be
                either "positioned" or "non-positioned" (right-click, Texture, "Reset Position" makes it non-positioned).
                However, non-positioned textures are reported at a bogus position by SketchUp's Ruby API when editing inside
                groups or components. We work around that by computing this bogus position on our own; then, if that is precisely
                what we get, we assume that it was a non-positioned texture that is misreported, and fix it manually. This
                might occasionally be foiled if it was actually a positioned texture that happened to be exactly at the same
                position.
            </p>
