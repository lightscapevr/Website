<h1>Virtual reality for architecture - state of the art</h1></a>
<p>Hello everyone.</p>
<p>VR Sketch is an editing/visualization tool for architects. Currently
integrates with <a class="reference external" href="https://www.sketchup.com">sketchup</a>, with more software coming in the future.
If you want to learn more, see the <a class="reference external" href="https://vrsketch.eu">main page</a>. This blog post is about the
current state of affairs in virtual reality for architecture from the
perspective of VR sketch.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>I don't think it's a secret that Virtual Reality is the future interface
for architecture. Everyone is talking about it, looking at and investigating
it. In this blog post I would like to do a review of the current potential
of VR ecosystem, mostly focusing on the hardware and low level software.
I'm deliberately <strong>not</strong> going to talk about the architecture software for VR,
since I'm more interested in what's possible as opposed to what has been
done.</p>
<p>First, let me reiterate the obvious - being able to <strong>see</strong> the building
you're designing (or a car or a piece of wood,
metal part or anything like that) is an incredible improvement over the status
quo. It's akin to what-you-see-is-what-you-get in text editors. There is
a good reason why Word is much more popular than TeX, punch cards got
obsolete and we draw lines with a mouse as opposed to typing
<tt class="docutils literal">line(0,0,100,100)</tt>. There are two more slightly less obvious benefits of
using VR - you have a very good camera control, as humans are used to just
moving their head to have new perspective and you have a clunky, but
usable, 3D point input with the controllers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="vr-visualizations-and-editing">
<h1>VR visualizations and editing</h1>
<p>Right now the king in VR for architecture is visualizations, especially for
the end client. There is a good reason for that - the minimum work required
to get the visualization going is relatively limited and does not require
deep interaction with controllers as UI. Doing visualizations that look good
is <strong>tons of work</strong> of course, but that part is (mostly) left out to users
themselves and not to the software. Obviously software has to allow it and
some make it easier than others. The obvious next step is seeing the buildings
as you design them and sooner or later one starts feeling that taking the helmet
on and off is annoying. That's where editing and VR sketch, comes to play.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the long list of limitations that are present. I hope
we will get around to addressing all of them, either in VR Sketch or in the
hardware.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="headsets">
<h1>Headsets</h1>
<p>VR Sketch for now works only in HTC Vive, but there is nothing stopping us
from working with other high-end headsets, other than having those headsets.
The headsets are <strong>good</strong>. Unlike the low-end tier, the illusion is very real
and the feel of space is good enough. I would not mind better resolution
for photo realism, more text etc. but it's all coming. Disclaimer:
I haven't had a chance
to play with the new headsets - Vive Pro or Samsung Odyssey.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="controllers-and-input">
<h1>Controllers and input</h1>
<p>The controllers and the general input is the main limiting factor of doing
editing right in the VR. One looses access to keyboard &amp; mouse, while gaining
access to relatively clunky controllers with limited buttons. The controllers
themselves are based a lot on gaming controllers plus six degress of freedom.
This works great for the primary purpose which is gaming! But for something
more professional, like work of architects, the lack of precision,
lack of buttons and lack of basic software research done in the terms of VR
user experience is a serious problem. We believe we did a good job given
the constraints, but there are very serious limitations that will make it
uneconomic to do certain edits in VR. We believe that those factors will
diminish over time -- we will improve the software, the controllers will
get better and eventually disappear in favor of hand gestures and people
will find it easier to do more and more stuff in VR. There is also issue
of text/measurment input which will probably be solved in a bunch of ways,
including voice support that we're working on.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ergonomics-of-office-space">
<h1>Ergonomics of office space</h1>
<p>Right now, since the building blocks are relatively large (think duplo instead
of lego), we need large space in order to work on a building. That brings
fatigue, due to large hand movements and requires a lot of free office space.
In the future, we will see stuff getting smaller and smaller to the point where
building buildings will remind a lot more about building stuff from legos,
but without stepping on them, then it is right now.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="road-to-the-future">
<h1>Road to the future</h1>
<p>The future is exciting :-) At VR Sketch we believe most architects will move
to editing in VR for day to day operations within 5-15 years. We are a bit
ahead of the curve here, but we will stick around to see it raise. You should
<a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/VrSketch">follow us on twitter</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://vrsketch.eu/#mailinglist">sign up to the mailing list</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://extensions.sketchup.com/pl/node/4716">download and use</a>
our software.</p>
<p>Exciting features we're working on right now:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Revit support.</li>
<li>Voice recognition.</li>
<li>Multi-user support.</li>
<li>Optimizing hand gestures to minimize movements.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are releasing new version with new cool features roughly every 2 months,
so you should <a class="reference external" href="https://extensions.sketchup.com/pl/node/4716">download and use</a> our software right now and follow our
development!</p>
<p>Cheers!
Maciej Fijalkowski &amp; the whole VR sketch team.</p>
