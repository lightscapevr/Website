# View Tools
These tools can be found by hovering the controller above the **Teleport** tool.

### Tape measure tool
Tape measure can be used for measuring distances and angles.

* The tool always projects a laser in front of it, with a green cross at the end. This green cross is also visible on the computer screen (it is a way to communicate between the person in VR and the person in front of the computer).
* The approximate distance between the controller and the green cross is displayed along the line.
* When the green cross is showing on a face, click the **trigger** to measure the length perpendicular to the face. (This is useful to measure e.g. the width of a corridor.)
* If you move the controller over an object, the tool switches to a different mode: Click the **trigger** once on the starting point, and another time on the ending point. You will see the distance between the two points. After this, move the controller around to see angles.
* The location of the second click is recorded as a special guide point. This point will show up for alignment in all tools that you use afterwards. To remove it, use the **eraser** tool.

#### Tape measure tool Context Menu options
* Lock direction to... - Locks the direction to an axis or plain.
* Unlock direction - Removes any locking constraints. This option only shows if the direction is locked.

### Section cut tool
The tool to temporarily cut your model.

* Move the controller to the point at which you want to draw the section plane. Click with the **trigger** to set the position of the plane, then move the controller to choose the axis perpendicular to the section plane. Click a second time to set the orientation of the plane.
* To remove a section plane, hold in the **â‹® tools button** and choose the **Delete section plane** tool. This tool is only visible if you have already created a section plane.
* You can also use the **eraser**, the **move** and the **rotate** tools on the section plane.
* You can only create one section plane at a time.

### Camera Tool
This tool lets you capture photos and videos of your model from inside VR.

* When the Camera tool is active you will see a preview window from the cameras point of view.
* Use the **Context Menu button** to change from Photo mode to Video mode.
* Click with the **trigger** to take a photo or if you are in video mode start or stop recording a video.
* Any photos you take will be saved to the current users "Pictures/VR Sketch" folder.
* Any videos you record will be saved to the current users "Videos/VR Sketch" folder.
* The **Context Menu button** can also be used to change to "fixed" mode.  Move in front of the camera to take photos and videos of yourself (or group selfies when viewing a cloud model).  You can still move a fixed camera by click and drag.

### Markup Tool (a.k.a. Notes Tool)
Draw colourful free hand lines that are not part of the geometry.

* To select a colour touch the **touchpad/thumbstick** to the colour you wish to draw with.
* To draw, hold in the **trigger** and move the controller. Release the **trigger** to stop drawing.
* To erase a drawing touch the **touchpad/thumbstick** to the drawing eraser tool. (In the same way you choose a colour) With the drawing eraser selected (Not the Eraser tool) hold in the **trigger** and move the controller. Release the **trigger** to stop erasing. The speed you move the eraser determines how big the eraser is.
* Drawing or erasing markup lines will not effect any geometry.
* Markup lines can be saved with SketchUp files.
* When viewing cloud models, you can draw markup lines but (so far) not save them.
* Markup lines appear in SketchUp too, but only if the "Send to VR" tool is currently selected in SketchUp.


## VR Videos

### Recording VR videos
* To start Recording, inside SketchUp, in top menu bar click **Extensions**, then click, **VR Sketch** then click **Recorded a VR Video...**. This will open a window in which you can set where the recording will be saved. As soon as this is set it will start recording.
* Press the **small top button** to stop your recording.
* Once you have finished your recording, you can press the **small top button** again to play back what you have just recorded.

### Playing VR videos
* To play back a VR recording, inside SketchUp, in top menu bar click **Extensions**, then click, **VR Sketch** then click **Play a VR Video...**. This will open a window in where you can choose which recording to open. The recording will start as soon as it is loaded.
* Press the **small top button** to stop or replay the loaded video.
