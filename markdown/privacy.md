# Privacy policy

We're dedicated to provide you full transparency into how we use personal in formation
and we're compliant with the new european data protection laws.

This is a description of what we do with personal information. We need to process
and retain some personal information in order to process payments. We do gather telemetry
data, and the software reports internal errors automatically, but both are stored in a
non-personally identifiable way.

We get and store your name and email address. If you're no longer a subscriber, email
info@baroquesoftware.com to get your information altered or completely deleted.
We use login via google, so you already had accepted google privacy policy.
For payments we pass the data to Chargebee (via embedded portal), who passes it to Braintree
 for processing payment information.
