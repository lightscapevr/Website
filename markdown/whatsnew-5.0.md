# What's new in 5.0

5.0 is a massive release for us. We implemented many things we have been
talking about and we have streamlines a lot of things that have been there
already. Overall VR Sketch 5.0 is we believe a massive improvement over previous
versions!

### Context menu

The biggest change is the context menu. Right now if you press **small top button**
on a Vive controller or **Y or B** on Oculus Rift, you would get a small context
menu that depends on the tool. You can read about all the posibilities in
[our drawing docs](docs-drawing.html)

### Viewing tools

We have completely revamped the view tools. They are now all available while
hovering over the teleport tool. You can explore yourself or read [our docs](docs-viewing.html).
Don't miss the new camera tool!

### 3d warehouse

You can now place components from the 3D warehouse directly! To do that,
go to components like usual, above select, and select the 3D warehouse panel.

### Scenes and Layers

Scenes now are accessible from the settings menu, near **Teleport tool**.
You can also make new scenes from your current viewpoint.  And in the
layers page, you can enable or disable them, as well as change the layer
in which groups and components are.

## Things that aren't new, but you might not have heard about them

### Collaboration

We have enabled cloud-based collaborative viewing of models! You can now
share the model and audio with other people with other VR headsets.

### Dynamic components

They say a picture is worth a 1000 words. How about a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zvx-odAwsI)?
