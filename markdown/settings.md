# Settings in SketchUp

### Icon tray
* Send to VR and teleport tool:
    * If the model has not already been sent to VR then this button will send the model to VR.
    * If the model is already in VR, click this button and then click anywhere in the model. This will teleport the person in VR to stand at the point you clicked. This is useful to move someone around your model.
* Copy VR location - Click this to align the SketchUp view point with the view of the VR headset. This is useful to see what the person in VR is looking at or working on.
* Configure VR view - This will open the configuration window for VR Sketch.

### Menu

* Center view - This will align the SketchUp view point with the view of the VR headset
* Configuration - This will open the configuration window for VR Sketch.

### Configuration options

#### Enable actions in VR
* Teleporting (trigger) - Toggles whether or not you can use the **Teleport** tool in VR.
* Move/scale/rotate model ("grip" buttons on the side)  - Toggles whether or not you can use the **grip** buttons to move, scale or rotate the model in VR.
* Editing (change tools with the touchpad) - Turn on or off the â‹® tools button.
#### Rendering
* Shadows follow SketchUp sun direction - Toggle whether or not the shadows follow the SketchUp setting for the sun direction (outside the warehouse only). Can be slightly confusing for the VR user, because when he or she rotates the model, the sun direction rotates too. This breaks the illusion that we are turning a model in our hands.
* Edges, Hide Rest Of Model, Fog - these are settings that you should configure normally inside SketchUp, and which will be mirrored in VR automatically.

#### Alignment
* This measure is in real-life mm. It changes how close to a point, axis or plane you must be before snapping occurs. It also changes the automatic rounding of distances. Default value: 35 mm.
