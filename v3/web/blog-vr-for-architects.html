        <p>Hello everyone.</p>
        <p>VR Sketch is an editing/visualization tool for architects. Currently integrates with
            <a class="reference external" href="https://www.sketchup.com">sketchup</a>, with more software coming
            in the future. If you want to learn more, see the
            <a class="reference external" href="https://vrsketch.eu">main page</a>. This blog post is about the
            current state of affairs in virtual reality for architecture from the perspective of VR sketch.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="introduction">
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>I don't think it's a secret that Virtual Reality is the future interface for architecture. Everyone
            is talking about it, looking at and investigating it. In this blog post I would like to do a review
            of the current potential of VR ecosystem, mostly focusing on the hardware and low level software.
            I'm deliberately
            <strong>not</strong> going to talk about the architecture software for VR, since I'm more interested
            in what's possible as opposed to what has been done.
        </p>
        <p>First, let me reiterate the obvious - being able to
            <strong>see</strong> the building you're designing (or a car or a piece of wood, metal part or anything
            like that) is an incredible improvement over the status quo. It's akin to what-you-see-is-what-you-get
            in text editors. There is a good reason why Word is much more popular than TeX, punch cards got obsolete
            and we draw lines with a mouse as opposed to typing
            <code>line(0,0,100,100)</code>. There are two more slightly less obvious benefits of using VR - you
            have a very good camera control, as humans are used to just moving their head to have new perspective
            and you have a clunky, but usable, 3D point input with the controllers.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="vr-visualizations-and-editing">
        <h3>VR visualizations and editing</h3>
        <img class="img-fluid shadow my-3" src="img/blog/VRSketch1.png">
        <p>Right now the king in VR for architecture is visualizations, especially for the end client. There
            is a good reason for that - the minimum work required to get the visualization going is relatively
            limited and does not require deep interaction with controllers as UI. Doing visualizations that look
            good is
            <strong>tons of work</strong> of course, but that part is (mostly) left out to users themselves and
            not to the software. Obviously software has to allow it and some make it easier than others. The
            obvious next step is seeing the buildings as you design them and sooner or later one starts feeling
            that taking the helmet on and off is annoying. That's where editing and VR sketch, comes to play.</p>
        <p>Which brings us to the long list of limitations that are present. I hope we will get around to addressing
            all of them, either in VR Sketch or in the hardware.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="headsets">
        <h3>Headsets</h3>
        <p>VR Sketch for now works only in HTC Vive, but there is nothing stopping us from working with other
            high-end headsets, other than having those headsets. The headsets are
            <strong>good</strong>. Unlike the low-end tier, the illusion is very real and the feel of space is
            good enough. I would not mind better resolution for photo realism, more text etc. but it's all coming.
            Disclaimer: I haven't had a chance to play with the new headsets - Vive Pro or Samsung Odyssey.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="controllers-and-input">
        <h3>Controllers and input</h3>
        <img class="img-fluid my-3" src="./img/blog/headsets-600x150.png">
        <p>The controllers and the general input is the main limiting factor of doing editing right in the VR.
            One loses access to keyboard &amp; mouse, while gaining access to relatively clunky controllers with
            limited buttons. The controllers themselves are based a lot on gaming controllers plus six degress
            of freedom. This works great for the primary purpose which is gaming! But for something more professional,
            like work of architects, the lack of precision, lack of buttons and lack of basic software research
            done in the terms of VR user experience is a serious problem. We believe we did a good job given
            the constraints, but there are very serious limitations that will make it uneconomic to do certain
            edits in VR. We believe that those factors will diminish over time -- we will improve the software,
            the controllers will get better and eventually disappear in favor of hand gestures and people will
            find it easier to do more and more stuff in VR. There is also issue of text/measurment input which
            will probably be solved in a bunch of ways, including voice support that we're working on.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="ergonomics-of-office-space">
        <h3>Ergonomics of office space</h3>
        <p>Right now, since the building blocks are relatively large (think duplo instead of lego), we need large
            space in order to work on a building. That brings fatigue, due to large hand movements and requires
            a lot of free office space. In the future, we will see stuff getting smaller and smaller to the point
            where building buildings will remind a lot more about building stuff from legos, but without stepping
            on them, then it is right now.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="road-to-the-future">
        <h3>Road to the future</h3>
        <p>The future is exciting :-) At VR Sketch we believe most architects will move to editing in VR for
            day to day operations within 5-15 years. We are a bit ahead of the curve here, but we will stick
            around to see it raise. You should
            <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/VrSketch">follow us on twitter</a>,

            <a class="reference external" href="https://extensions.sketchup.com/pl/node/4716">download and use</a>
            our software.</p>
        <p>Exciting features we're working on right now:</p>
        <ul class="simple">
            <li>Revit support.</li>
            <li>Voice recognition.</li>
            <li>Multi-user support.</li>
            <li>Optimizing hand gestures to minimize movements.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We are releasing new version with new cool features roughly every 2 months, so you should
            <a class="reference external" href="https://extensions.sketchup.com/pl/node/4716">download and use</a>
            our software right now and follow our development!
